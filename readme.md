# FACE TATTOO FILTER

This filter is a project for the University of Lethbridge's New Media course: Dynamic Web NMED 3720. 

I decided for sake of learning the library to make a filter that focused primarily on just being able to track images according to the face tracking data we were given from [this repository](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr_). I created the tattoos in Illustrator, loosely using some web development related themes. There should be HTML and CSS under each eye, a teardrop under HTML not to signify homicide but rather the web developer's struggle, as well as JS for javascript on the chin (mostly), and some stars and a wifi symbol on the forehead. Most of developing this filter was just trying to get the tattoos as close as possible to the right position, manipulating the x and y values until they looked somewhat close whenever it would actually line up. Despite my efforts, it does struggle to find my face accurately more often than not. I hope this is mostly due to my poor camera and even poorer lighting in my room. That being said, it does line up for me if I force it to, and when it does it's sweet. The tattoos have been given a tint to make them slightly more translucent, and in turn look more like tattoos.

Thanks for reading and trying it out!
